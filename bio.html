<p>I am a Computer Science and Economics double major at Tufts University, and I'm from Scarsdale, NY. I have a passion for data science and am looking to work in an analytics or software development role in the near future. I have performed some indepedent projects in R and Python, but I am looking to expand on the techniques I use to build predictive models and manage data better.</p>
